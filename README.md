## Planning

I wanted a site with a high level of interactivity, hence the main page has interactivity as soon as it is loaded, I knew I wanted a sort of grid system and so used bootstrap to find and implement a grid in mt code, and then populated it with links and images as well as styled it

### Wireframes

## Design

Design is very important to me as it is the first thing a user notices when they reach your site, A bad design may cost you visitors who may be put off.

### Colour scheme
The main colour scheme for this project is Orange and Blue. I used premade background images that properly complement each other on the page.
The header portion of the page is mainly orange, while the rest of the body is Blue.

### Colours that were used

- Orange
- Blue
- Black
- Cyan
- White




## Font

the font family used is :

Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif

This was done to ensure maximum readability of the webpage in lieu of any potentially distracting designs regarding the font.

 ## Testing against my User Goals

- ### As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate the site to find the information I need.
I added a very prominent navigation bar which inidicates clearly to the user where they need to go in order to add/remove information

- ### As a user, I want to see a visually appealing and responsive site.
he site uses bright and appealing colours that also more importantly do not get in the way of the purpose of the site

- ### As a user, I want to able to feel a sense of security.
Users are able to securely log in and log out 

- ### As a user, I want to be able to add , edit and delete information as needed.
Users are able to create accounts and log in, which allows them to be able to add or make changes to the facts that are attached to each state.

- ### As a user, I want to have my data saved so I dont have to repeat the same process eah time I buy something
After making a purchase, your data is saved so you can come back and make a new purchase. your data will then be pre filled when you reach checkout


## Testing responsiveness on multiple screen sizes

Using Google chromes Ispect element, I tested the site against various screen sizes, the site has proved to be responsive within all these sizes.



## BUGS

site became jumbled up on screen reduction, fixed with media query in CSS
