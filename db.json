According to scholars, humans began to Create art in the form of paintings on cave walls, jewellery and also music approximately 50 millennia ago. This rudimentary music most likely had a much simpler form, and mainly consisted of singing, the clapping of hands or the banging of items on various surfaces to produce a sound. This helped them to build an identity , increase their chances of survival and served to lay the groundwork for what music would eventually evolve into music as we know it. Our early ancestors were said to also craft very simple instruments with which they could play even more complex forms of music but  the approximate date is mostly unknown.\r\n\r\nDjive Baba flute, the first instrument\r\n\r\nOne such famous instrument is the Djive Baba flute. This flute was discovered in a cave in Slovenia in the mid nineties, and is thought o be at least fifty thousand years old. The subject of whether or not it truly was a musical instrument used by our ancestors is a controversial one, with some scholars claiming that the flute is just a bone fragment that had been chewed up by an ancient animal. The reason why this explanation is most likely flawed is because the bone has holes that are almost perfect in shape and are also perfectly spaced apart and so therefore was intentionally crafted by human hands. Over the years, other instruments were discovered with furthered the theory that our ancient ancestors has musical instruments although there is no proper record of this.\r\n\r\nSpread\r\n\r\nAs humans began to disperse all around the world, they took their knowledge of music with them. As various cultures and civilisations began to appear, their music also evolved alongside them into something completely different. The music within a particular culture is what it is because of many determining factors, like the climate, their own personal\r\n\r\nexperiences and what sort of technology they had invented at the time or had access to. These factors, obviously being drastically different in various groups would result in completely different forms of music around the globe. Because at this time there were no proper form of written records this kind of music is called prehistoric music. Later in history, as humans were getting round to recording their feats we were able to take records of our music, and by then music had already become reasonably diverse in its forms in the world. This is mostly known as ancient music and goes as far back as 1000 BC.\r\n\r\nSo now we know that music is indeed very old. But what happened after the advent of historically recorded music? As various cultures began to develop so did their music. The people that eventually settled in Europe initially developed medieval music, as this was the only kind of music available to them at the time, around the year 1400. This form of music\r\n\r\nalthough complex in itself was still relatively very simple in nature at the time. But that changed when renaissance music was introduced. The exact beginning of renaissance music is not clearly stated but it was mostly believed to have began in Italy, but others argue that renaissance music actually began in Northern Europe ,more specifically central and northern France, the Netherlands and Belgium.This style of music was highly favoured because of its smooth polyphonic nature. As technology advanced, so did the methods with which music was preserved and shared. Printing had been invented and  therefore aided in the the mass dissemination of music. Baroque and Classical music also made an appearance before the turn of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nAll other cultures and groups underwent their own form of music discovery and as time progressed their music evolved as well. Fast forward to the 20th century and almost every continent had their own form of music unique to them alone. In places like west Africa, drums and rhythmic music became the identity of their culture. India and other parts of Asia are also characterised by monophonic(based on a single melody)etc. Present day music is the most evolved and complex form of music. The factors that caused for music to be different within various cultures do not apply as much as before(access to technology, climate etc) and the world has become a global village.\r\n\r\nMusic in its current form\r\n\r\nMusic genres were born from the fact that different people have different tastes in music,Classical music from the classical era is still so popular that it still persists today as a genre of music preserved on the internet. So many other genres are the direct result of the persistence of ancient music, like Afropop in west Africa, which focuses on rhythm and drums.\r\n\r\nWhat is your favourite genre of music? Is it hiphop?jazz? Or is it classical music? They all developed from centuries of evolution and we can thank our predecessors for what we currently call music.", "created_on": "2022-07-01T20:04:46.102Z", "status": 1}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 3, "fields": {"title": "HOW TO MAKE MONEY RECORDING AUDIOBOOKS AT HOME", "slug": "how-to-make-money-recording-audiobooks-at-home", "author": 1, "updated_on": "2022-07-01T20:05:54.145Z", "content": "Why Audiobooks?\r\n\r\nIf someone asked me about two or three years ago,” what is the best form of consuming literature?”, I wouldn’t have hesitated to tell them it was reading books. Books have been a staple of any culture for hundreds  of years and and still remain incredibly popular even today. But there’s just one problem, books are in the decline. It is happening very slowly but surely, and the world dipping further into the depths of technology is mostly to blame. Today, people want information or content as fast  and as conveniently as possible. Books have begun to be seen as bulky and unwieldy, losing favour with the younger generations who prefer to use a simpler way to read novels and other text in the form of ebooks on their smart devices. Another more convenient form of consuming the content within books are the use of Audiobooks, these are audio versions of books that are listened to on any device that can play them including phones, tablets or personal computers. Audiobooks, in the years since their introduction have proved to be extremely popular and there is a steadily growing market for this form of media. Audiobooks are now the fastest growing type of media in the world. To put things into perspective, in 2018 more audiobooks were downloaded online than ebooks. That goes a long way to show the emerging dominance audiobooks are beginning to assert. But with every large market comes opportunity, and that is what is going to be detailed in this article.\r\n\r\nBecoming an audiobook narrator is not overly difficult. Not only is it possible it has been shown to be considerably profitable.The great thing about becoming an audiobook narrator is that it doesn’t take very much to get started. Some of the things you may need include;\r\n\r\nA laptop\r\nSoftware for recording like Logic Pro or Ableton\r\nA pair of headphones\r\nA microphone\r\nAs an optional requirement, joining ACX , a subsidiary of audible, one of the biggest audiobook marketplaces in the world, could be beneficial in getting started. ACX is very useful because they assist you in claiming royalties if you work on any books and copies of them get sold. They will also help you manage your content in general. ACX is not the only platform out there but is certainly the biggest.\r\n\r\nOther options include listenup audiobooks and CDBaby\r\n\r\nHow should you go about it?\r\n\r\nThe process is not overly simple but not complicated either. A bit of practice learning about your sound recording software of choice goes a long way to make things easier for you as well. If you choose to record using Logic Prom try to learn as much as you can about how the interface works and how audio is recorded on the software. Make sure your surroundings are as quiet as possible. If you have room that you can dedicate to this then do so, if not, any enclosure like a wardrobe where sound isn’t likely to leak through will do. It also helps to get soundproof foam to help you with this. Once you have all these boxes ticked you can then proceed to record, edit, and get your recording ready to export and upload.\r\n\r\nHow much can narrators potentially make?\r\n\r\nThe revenue that can be made from recording audiobooks from home varies because of a few factors like your experience, hours recorded, professional background etc. But generally there are two ways you can make money from recording audiobooks.\r\n\r\nThe first is simply the flat rate or simply how much you make per hour recording the audiobook. This is especially relevant when recording an audiobook on behalf of a client. An amount can be agreed on, and each hour spent recording warrants a payment of said amount.\r\n\r\nThe second way of generating revenue is in the form of royalties. These are also pre agreed terms where a percentage of all sales of the audiobook go to you the narrator. The amount that goes to you varies and are mostly determined by the aforementioned factors but have been known to be capable of going as high as 50%. That is essentially half of all sales of the audiobook which can prove to be extremely lucrative if the the audiobook sells very well. Considering that the bulk of revenue generated from narrating audiobooks are more passive than anything else they can easily be done to supplement any job.\r\n\r\nShould you jump into recording audiobooks?\r\n\r\nThe answer is a resounding yes. Audiobook recording has substantial monetary benefits and if you have the confidence in you speech bailey and voice then there is no time to be wasted deliberating as there is a lot to be gained. Using platforms like ACX also speed up the process making things simpler for you as they package your finished recording and distribute it to marketplaces like audible and apple iBooks.Seize the day, Carpe Diem!", "created_on": "2022-07-01T20:05:54.145Z", "status": 1}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "12 THINGS EVERY MUSIC LOVER NEEDS TO KNOW", "slug": "12-things-every-music-lover-needs-to-know", "author": 1, "updated_on": "2022-07-01T20:06:38.735Z", "content": "It’s never too early to get started in music and neither is it ever too late to follow your dreams .John Lennon started his singing career as a choir boy at St. Peter’s church.\r\n\r\nDon’t be afraid to have fun with your friends and share ideas .Group singing has been scientifically proven to lower stress, relieve anxiety, and elevate endorphins in the body. This allows us to be more creative, feel more relaxed and free and generally improves our state of mind.\r\nAlways be willing to improvise because it has numerous benefits including boosting your overall creativity.Researchers found that when jazz musicians improvise, their brains turn off areas linked to self-censoring and inhibition, and turn on those that let self-expression flow.\r\nListening to music a lot can have a significant calming effect on our brains.Babies remain calm twice as long when listening to a song as they do when listening to speech, according to a study.\r\nThere’s never a bad time to create music because you never know when or where inspiration might rear its head.Eminem wrote and recorded “The Real Slim Shady” just 3 hours before his album was due. Always be willing to get creative as soon as inspiration hits you.\r\nMusic is awesome! Music triggers activity in the same brain structure that releases the “pleasure chemical” dopamine during eating or accomplishing a task . Unfortunately, not everyone has the ability to enjoy music to the fullest. About 5% of the worlds population  have a biological disdain for music, called “musical anhedonia.\r\nIf you are an artist looking to earn an income from music , streaming has now become the way to go. Streams, downloads and subscriptions outpaced CD sales in the U.S. for the first time in 2014.\r\nAlthough you can sell more using online platforms and streaming services, it is not as profitable as CD sales. For every US$1000 of music sold, the average musician makes just US$23.40. Doesn’t seem like a lot unfortunately.\r\nYou don’t need to be able to read or write music to be able to create or enjoy music, The most important trait you need is creativity. Jimi Hendrix couldn’t read or write music. Frank Sinatra never formally learned how to read music. Also none of The Beatles Could Read Music.\r\nMusic has the power to shape entire cultures .Thats because the type of music you listen to affects the way you perceive the world. So the type of music directly affects the nature of cultures and customs of a demographic.\r\nMusic affects our bodies! Your heartbeat changes and mimics the music you listen to. Also Listening to music while working out has bee proven to significantly improve physical performance. Loud music can even make a person drink more in less time!\r\nNostalgia also plays a part in the type of music you are drawn to. Studies have shown that You don’t like the original version of a song because it’s better, You like it because it’s the one you heard first.

In movies, music conveys a particular feeling or mood that is designed to compliment a scene. Try to imagine some of the iconic scenes in film, like that scene in the matrix where Neo(played by the legendary Keanu Reaves) dodges a barrage of bullets with such flair and grace. Now, imagine how you felt ,indeed, It was the music that set the mood and tone of the whole scene.\r\n\r\nHOW DOES MUSIC MAKE US FEEL?\r\n\r\nThere is a myriad of purposes for which music can be used.Music can be used as a form of entertainment,It can be used to give an instruction, music can even be used to set a particular mood.In this manner music cannot be looked at as a mere collection of vibrations strung together to form sounds and subsequently notes, but also as a piece of art that affects us on a much deeper level, deeper than even our consciousness. We must all ourselves,”how does music make me feel? Because the truth is that we all will have varying answers to that question.The same piece of music can strike so many different reactions in so many people, but one thing is usually constant, music has a positive effect on us more often than not. It is indeed a very powerful tool when it comes personal and spiritual growth.It is a well known fact that the environment that a person finds themselves in has a higher potency on their lives than even their will power. What we find ourselves surrounded by also shapes our thoughts, moods, attitudes etc. In this regard the power of music cannot be underestimated as it acts on our consciousness far more than any other mediums of communication possibly can.Music is a vibration that easily bypasses any mental and rational defences to affect us on energetic and emotional levels, often regardless of mere things like genre and lyrics .Music even affects us on cellular and atomic levels, as demonstrated by studies with plants and ice crystals.\r\n\r\nMUSIC SPEAKS TO US\r\n\r\nAlong this vein of thought, it is therefore possible to harness music to induce an individual to think along certain lines as a direct result of the music they are listening to, thus effectively communicating an idea in the broadest of forms to them.\r\n\r\nAccording to scholars, there are various ways through which one is able to feel or understand the message that is within a piece of music but there are two paramount ways through which a feeling or message is conveyed through music.\r\n\r\nThe first way is how the music inherently has specific qualities designed to trigger a specific emotional response in those who listen to it. This is accomplished through devices like melody, tempo, rhythm ,harmony, the choice of instruments and also the style of play. For example chords from a piano  will have a different effect on our brains compared to if it were a guitar.\r\n\r\nThe second way is how music draws responses based on our own internal emotions. Certain types of music can trigger memories for people, a term known as nostalgia. In this manner all the feelings related to said memories may affect the listener.\r\n\r\nUNDERSTANDING MUSIC\r\n\r\nSome composers also prefer to give a brief talk before they play their music piece, normally to explain what their piece symbolises. This is because some music can be so complex that they require an initial explanation in order to “guide” the listener along a particular path, lest the composers message be lost in translation.\r\n\r\nIn the end, What is ultimately communicated through any piece of music is the consciousness and magnetism of both composer and performers: their attitudes, their emotions, their aspirations (or lack thereof), and their approach to life’s challenges. Do the artists merely express problem-consciousness, or do they actually offer solutions? Do they basically sit around and complain, or are they trying to understand?\r\n\r\nIn order to objectively  hear what a piece of music is saying in and of itself, it is very important to listen without becoming too emotionally involved, in other words, allow your inner feelings, memories etc. to cloud your judgement. This is known as the neutralisation of self.Listening to a piece of music in this state allows one to feel what the music is saying on its own.\r\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegardless of age, race, nationality or gender, music is a beautiful thing and its messages are diverse and have so many different effects on us as humans. The next time you are walking down the street try to listen to the music around you and try to decipher what the music is trying to say to you. Will it give you warm fuzzy feelings inside or will it remind you of your childhood? The possibilities are endless!", "created_on": "2022-07-01T20:07:48.756Z", "status": 1}}]
